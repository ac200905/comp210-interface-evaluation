          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
		  <br>
		  <p> Overall the main issues appear to be the player movement input, intermittent faults with the firing mechanism and the sturdiness of certain elements of the controller, chiefly the crank that controls player movement. </p>
        <br>
		<p>The heuristic evaluation was a vital part of my research and help inform the base of my survey and A/B test. Having discovered that the movement controls were an issue, I was able to write the survey and set out the test accordingly.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The amount of data I gathered during the evaluation was less than ideal. If more research was done in the future, a larger dataset with more concise and specific survey questions would improve the results dramatically.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If the development of the Controller continues, an iterative approach of testing, implementing possible solutions suggested in the report and then re-evaluating the controlller should be taken. </p>
