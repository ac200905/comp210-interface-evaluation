          <h2>Analysis of Results</h2>
		  <br>
		  
		  
		  <h3>Crank Sturdiness</h3>
		  <p>One issue raised was that the crank used to control player movement was not sturdy enough. This problem is somewhat corroberated in the results of the survey depicted in Figure 8. This chart shows that nearly half of the participants disagreed with the idea that the crank seemed sturdy enough for sustained play. When compared to the fact that 90 percent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the rest of the controller seemed sturdy enough for sustained play, this suggests to me that the crank would benefit from an improvement of it's design.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Directional Movement</h3>
		<p>Another issue that was raised in the heuristic evaluation was the switching of player movement directions. As it stands, the Crank moves the player Vertically or Horizontally depending on the status of a switch at the back of the controller. According to feedback from the experts, this appears to limit player freedom and cause confusion and frustration to the player. Data gathered from the survey in Figure 6 also suggests that participants generally agree with this sentiment, with half the participants suggesting this method was not intuitive and 60 percent of participants not having a clear notion of how to move in a desired direction at any one time. This suggests that perhaps a visual aid on the interface should be added or that a re-design of the player movement input might be necessary. One possibility suggested by experts is that the need for a switch is negated by way of including a second crank that could work in conjunction with the first to produce simultaneous bidirectional movement. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>Difficulty vs Fun</h3>
		<p>The survey results show that 100 percent of participants found the Controller fun to use as evidenced in Figure 1. This chart also suggests that only 30 percent of participants thought of the controller as difficult to use while 40 percent disagreed. This implies that the fun factor of the controller was not necessarily impeeded by how difficult participants found it to use. On the contrary, the fact that 80 percent of participants preferred using the Controller to the Keyboard controls as stated in Figure 5, despite the chart in Figure 3 that shows significantly higher scores when using the keyboard, a hypothesis could be made that the extra challenge that using the controller provides made the game more fun for the participants.  </p>
		<p>Figure 4 suggests that the controller aesthetic may also play a part in why the controller is more fun to use, since 100 percent of participants agreed that this added to the feeling of immersion when playing the game.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Physical Feedback</h3>
		<p>In the heuristic evaluation, experts suggested that tactile response from the crank as well as the physical nature of the firing mechanism were beneficial to the user experience. This is supported by the chart in Figure 2 which shows that 80 percent of participants felt that the firing mechanism was satisfying. There is a correlation between this and the results in Figure 4 that speaks to the controller feeling immersive. This might suggest that the physicality of how the controller functions adds to the Controllers' immersion value. </p>
