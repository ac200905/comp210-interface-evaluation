          <h2>Methodology One: Heuristic Evaluation
The first research method will be a heuristic evaluation of the controller. 
The evaluation will be carried out by three BSc Computing for Games students. There are seven heuristic I the experts will be evaluating:
1.	Controller Layout
2.	Burden on the Player
3.	Game Story Immersion
4.	Error Prevention
5.	User Control and Freedom
6.	Visibility of System Status
7.	Controller Provides Feedback

          <h2>Methodology Two: Survey (with A/B Testing)
The second research method in this report will be a combination of A/B Testing and a Survey. 
 
I intend to have each participant play the game until they run out of lives, first using basic keyboard controls and then again with the Cannon-Controller.  I will note down how the participant scored in each game using the two different controller types. 
I am doing this for several reasons:
1.	In order to discern any quantitative contrast in the scores, thus gaining an insight into how difficult the Cannon-Controller is to use.
2.	In order to find out which controller the participant prefers to use.

In order to eliminate bias I will let the participant play the game with each controller for one minute each before the tests in order for them to get used to the controls. 
I will record several things about each test:
1.	Number of Regular enemies killed
2.	Number of Quick enemies killed
3.	Number of Boss enemies killed
