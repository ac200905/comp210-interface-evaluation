          <h2>Methodology One: Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
         <br>
<p>The first research method will be a heuristic evaluation of the controller. 
The evaluation will be carried out by three BSc Computing for Games students. Due to the small scope of the project I feel that three evaluators are sufficient. All three experts have experience creating bespoke controllers and experience with game development and testing. The heuristics I have chosen have been adapted from those suggested by the Nielsen Norman Group. Each individual expert will inspect the interface alone and may ask for clarification only after the evaluations are complete or if a problem arises with the controller. This is important to ensure the evaluations are as unbiased as possible. </p>
<p>The results of this heuristic evaluation will help inform what questions and issues to raise during the development of the second methodology.</p>
<p>There are seven heuristics that the experts will be evaluating that are specific to the controller:</p>
<br>
<p>1.	Controller Layout</p>
<p>2.	Burden on the Player</p>
<p>3.	Game Story Immersion</p>
<p>4.	Error Prevention</p>
<p>5.	User Control and Freedom</p>
<p>6.	Visibility of System Status</p>
<p>7.	Controller Provides Feedback</p>

          <h2>Methodology Two: Survey (with A/B Testing)</h2>
         <br>
<p>The second research method in this report will be a combination of A/B Testing and a Survey. I have decided this is the best course to take after collating the findings of my <a href="images/HCI Journal.pdf">Research Journal</a>. </p>
<p>Surveys are quick and efficient at easily collecting data which is ideal for the short timeframe I have to evaluate the controller.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, I aim to get at least 10 people to complete the test and survey, given more resources the sample size would ideally be much larger however. </p>
<p>The survey will be composed of only 12 simple questions most of which use the likert scale to gather quantitative data on qualitative issues. Keeping the survey short and to the point will hopefully illicit the most accurate results. </p>

<p>I intend to have each participant play the game until they run out of lives, first using basic keyboard controls and then again with the Cannon-Controller.  I will note down how the participant scored in each game using the two different controller types.</p> 
<p>I am doing this for several reasons:</p>
<br>
<p>1.	In order to discern any quantitative contrast in the scores, thus gaining an insight into how difficult the Cannon-Controller is to use.</p>
<p>2.	In order to find out which controller is more popular.</p>
<p>3.	In order to discern any correlations between scores and prefered controller or percieved difficulty of the controller.</p>
<br>
<p> A/B testing is usually undertaken without the participants knowing they are using an alternate version of a piece of software, however in this test I will ask participants to use both versions so that they can be compared in the follow up survey. In order to eliminate bias I will let the participant play the game with each controller for one minute each before the tests in order for them to get used to the controls. The majority of participants will be sourced from the games academy for convenience. This should be acceptable for this evaluation but I acknowledge that different demographics may give different results. A wider sample net would be cast ideally.  </p>
<p>I will record several things about each test:</p>
<br>
<p>1.	Number of Regular enemies killed</p>
<p>2.	Number of Quick enemies killed</p>
<p>3.	Number of Boss enemies killed</p>
<p>4. Final Score</p>
